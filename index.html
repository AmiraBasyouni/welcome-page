	    This is a personal web page that showcases two meaningful subjects that relate to me.
	    
	    Each section is meant to fill your entire view port.
	    This is to help make the focus of the page is clear while introducing you to each topic gradually.
	    
	    As you shrink the screen, eventually the image and text components should stack on top of one another.
	    I did this using a screen media query that activates at a specified width.
	    I made sure the page still looks aesthetically appealing when stacked.
	    The components stretch, as needed, to fill the space horizontally.
	    I also added a button labeled 'top' that helps you get back to the top of the welcome-page.
	    This was done to ease the navigation.
	    Lastly, I found a color pallet on the internet.
	    This was to create a visually pleasing pattern without detracting from the web content.

	    I accounted for accessibility by using semantic HTML markup and providing an alt text for all images.
	    I feared that nesting my sections into div tags would decrease accessibility.
	    I made sure to nest each piece of text in a section tag, while including an appropriate heading.

	    It might not be obvious, but I struggled a lot to create this web page.
	    I had to redesign my page just to make the programming more feasible.
	    I have tried to learn HTML and CSS in the past, but there are times CSS does not feel intuitive.
	    Why does the block not stretch? Why do the components not align side by side?
	    In general, although drawing up a sketch is easy, implementing it takes much longer and proves to be challenging.
